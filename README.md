# Packman
This is the lovely Packman game by Mahdi Teymoori Anar.
## Requirements:
Java is required to run this program. It uses Javafx so probably openJDK won't work and you should have ORACLE java.
## How to run and what OS is needed?
The main program is a JAR file in the folder <i>"files"</i> and can be run on any os (windows, linux, mac OS) if you have JAVA whith the code below is terminal:

          java -jar Packman.jar
          
However there is an autorun available for windows, <b><i>Packman.exe</i></b>, which is just beside this README file and <u>not</u> in <i>files</i> folder.
